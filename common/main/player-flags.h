 * However, that generates worse code due to passing 16-bit values wherever
 * `player_flag` is used as an argument to a function.
 *
 * Descent 1 uses few enough distinct values that it could be reduced to
 * `uint8_t`.  However, some of its values are currently above UINT8_MAX, so
 * they would need to be renumbered.  That would require special code in the
 * save/load paths to map between the historical values written to disk and the
 * renumbered values used in memory.  The savings is not sufficient to justify
